%   X      : a Nx3 (or 3xN) data matrix
%              each row (columns) contains x, y, z measurements
%              N must be such that the data set describes
%              as completely as possible the 3D space
%              In any case N > 10
%              
%    The calibration tries to find the best 3D ellipsoid that fits the data set
%    and returns the parameters of this ellipsoid
%
%    U     :  shape ellipsoid parameter, (3x3) upper triangular matrix
%    c      : ellipsoid center, (3x1) vector
%
%    Ellipsoid equation : (v-c)'*(U'*U)(v-c) = 1 
%    with v a rough triaxes magnetometer  measurement
%
%    calibrated measurement w = U*(v-c)
